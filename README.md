# 🪐 Meta Bridge - Cross-Chain NFT Bridge with Fractional Ownership

Meta Bridge is a **cross-chain NFT bridge protocol** built in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain.
It enables NFT owners to securely bridge their assets across supported chains, fractionalize ownership, earn royalties, and participate in decentralized governance.

## ✨ Features

* 🔗 **Cross-Chain NFT Bridging** – Move NFTs between Stacks and multiple blockchains.
* 📈 **Fractional Ownership** – Split NFTs into tradable shares (fractions).
* 💸 **Royalty Streaming** – Automated royalty distribution to fractional owners.
* 🗳 **DAO Governance** – Token-based voting and proposals for protocol upgrades.
* 🔒 **Validator System** – Multi-signature validation with reputation tracking.
* ⚡ **Emergency Controls** – Admin pause/unpause bridge operations.
